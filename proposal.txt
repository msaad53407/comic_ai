Project Proposal: AI Comic Generator
## 1. Introduction
The AI Comic Generator is a PHP-based web application designed to create complete comic pages from simple text prompts. It leverages artificial intelligence to generate storylines, dialogues, and corresponding comic-style illustrations with integrated dialogue bubbles. The system aims to simplify comic creation for users who lack artistic skills while offering creative storytelling possibilities through AI automation.
## 2. Objectives
The main objective of the project is to provide an intuitive platform for generating comic pages automatically from text input. Users can input a short story idea, and the system will generate comic panels with dialogues embedded in the artwork. This allows for creative expression, visual storytelling, and quick content generation.
## 3. Core Features
•	AI-based story generation: Automatically creates short comic narratives and dialogues.
•	AI-based image generation: Produces comic-style images with embedded dialogues and panels.
•	User input interface: Simple form to input prompt and style preferences.
•	Comic layout generation: Creates multi-panel comic pages in a single image.
•	Data storage: Stores generated comics, prompts, and metadata in a MySQL database.
•	User history and management: Allows users to view, download, or delete their previous creations.
•	Regeneration and customization: Option to modify storylines or regenerate specific panels.
•	Download and sharing: Export generated comics as image or PDF files.
## 4. Technology Stack
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface and image preview)
•	Backend: PHP (handles API requests, data storage, and comic generation logic)
•	Database: MySQL (stores users, prompts, and generated comics)
•	AI APIs: OpenAI / Stability AI / DALL·E (for text and image generation)
## 5. System Architecture
1. The user submits a story prompt through the web interface.
2. The PHP backend processes the prompt and sends it to an AI text model to generate scene descriptions and dialogues.
3. The backend then sends structured requests to an AI image generator to create a complete comic page.
4. The resulting comic image is saved to the database and displayed to the user.
5. Users can download, regenerate, or share their comic outputs.
